# Contributing to MTG Rulings Bot

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project. Your help is greatly appreciated.

## How to Contribute

We use a `main` branch for production-ready code and a `dev` branch for development. Please follow these steps to contribute:

1.  **Fork the repository** and clone it to your local machine.
2.  **Create a new branch** from the `dev` branch for your feature or bug fix. Please name your branch descriptively (e.g., `feature/new-card-search` or `fix/chat-display-bug`).
3.  **Make your changes** and commit them with clear, descriptive messages.
4.  **Push your branch** to your forked repository.
5.  **Create a pull request** from your branch to the `dev` branch of the main repository. **All pull requests must be made to the `dev` branch.** Pull requests to the `main` branch will be closed.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
