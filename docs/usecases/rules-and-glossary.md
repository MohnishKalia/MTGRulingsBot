# Rules and Glossary

The MTGRulingsBot can answer questions about the rules of Magic: The Gathering and define game-specific terminology.

## How to Use

To ask a question about the rules or get a definition for a keyword, simply ask the bot a question. The bot will use the `fetchVectorDB` tool to search through the Magic Tournament Rules (MTR), the Comprehensive Rules, and the Magic Glossary to find the most relevant information.

**Example 1:**

> for an enchantment with Shroud, would a spell be able to target it? what about an an ability?

**Example 2:**

> if my opponent accidentally looks at their top deck, do they lose?

The bot will provide a clear and concise answer based on the information found in the official documents.
