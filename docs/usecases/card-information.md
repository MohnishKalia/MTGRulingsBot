# Card Information

The MTGRulingsBot can provide detailed information about any Magic: The Gathering card, including its rulings, mana cost, type line, oracle text, and power/toughness.

## How to Use

To get information about a card, simply ask the bot a question and include the card's name. You can wrap the card name in quotes for clarity, but it's not required.

**Example 1:**

> how does "Twinflame Tyrant" work with `Inquisitor's Flail` on a creature

**Example 2:**

> What can a 'Collected Company' bring out with a Trinisphere and thalia active

The bot will use the `fetchCardDetails` tool to retrieve the most up-to-date information about the requested cards and present it to you in a clear and organized format.
